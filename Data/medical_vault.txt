Benefits of Shilajit
What are the benefits of Shilajit for Fatigue?
scientificModern Science View	Fatigue occurs when your body cells do not produce enough energy. Shilajit is used as a revitalizer to enhance physical performance and relieve fatigue. This is due to the presence of fulvic and humic acid which helps the mitochondria present in the cells to produce energy[13].
ayurvedicAyurvedic View	Shilajit is useful in managing fatigue in the day to day life. Fatigue refers to a feeling of tiredness, weakness or lack of energy. According to Ayurveda, fatigue is referred to as 'Klama' which is due to imbalance in the Kapha dosha. Shilajit helps to reduce fatigue due to its Balya (strength provider) and Rasayana (rejuvenating) properties. It also helps balance Kapha and thus reduce fatigue.
Tip:
1. Take 1 Shilajit capsule with lukewarm milk after meals.
2. Continue this once a day for 2-3 months for better results.
What are the benefits of Shilajit for Alzheimer's disease?
scientificModern Science View	Shilajit might reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s disease. In Alzheimer’s patients, there is an increase in the production of a protein called amyloid beta protein leading to the formation of amyloid plaques or clusters in the brain. A study states that fulvic acid present in Shilajit can reduce the formation of amyloid plaques in the brain. This might make Shilajit a promising therapy for Alzheimer’s disease[10].
ayurvedicAyurvedic View	Alzheimer's disease is an age-related, irreversible, nervous disorder. Some of the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are memory loss and a change in behavior.
Shilajit helps to reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease by balancing Vata dosha. It also has Rasayana (rejuvenating) property that reduces weakness of the nervous system and improves its functioning.
Tip:
1. Take 2-4 pinch of Shilajit powder.
2. Mix it with honey or take with lukewarm milk.
3. Take it twice a day after meals.
What are the benefits of Shilajit for Respiratory tract infection?
scientificModern Science View	Shilajit might help manage respiratory tract infections most prevalent in children. A study states that Shilajit can act against HRSV, a virus that causes respiratory tract infections commonly in children due to its antiviral property[11].
ayurvedicAyurvedic View	Shilajit helps to remove the obstruction in the respiratory tract. This is because the main doshas involved in respiratory problems are Vata and Kapha. The vitiated Vata combines with deranged Kapha dosha in the lungs causing obstruction in the respiratory passage.
Shilajit helps to balance Vata-Kapha and remove the obstruction in the respiratory passage. It also helps to increase immunity to fight against infection due to its Rasayana (rejuvenating) property.
Tip:
1. Take 2-4 pinch of Shilajit powder.
2. Mix it with honey.
3. Take it twice a day after meals.
What are the benefits of Shilajit for Cancer?
scientificModern Science View	Free radicals which are generated during cancer chemotherapy can damage the normal cells around the vicinity of the tumor cell. This makes cancer treatment painful. Fulvic and humic acid present in Shilajit destroys the free radicals with its antioxidant property. This helps in minimizing the pain in cancer treatment[12].
ayurvedicAyurvedic View	In Ayurveda, Cancer is described as inflammatory or non-inflammatory swelling and is called either as ‘Granthi’ (minor neoplasm) or ‘Arbuda‘ (major neoplasm).
In the case of cancer, all three doshas, Vata-Pitta-Kapha gets out of control. This leads to a loss in mutual coordination among cells leading to tissue damage. Shilajit helps to build mutual coordination and prevents tissue damage because of its Balya (strength provider) and Rasayana (rejuvenating) properties.
What are the benefits of Shilajit for Heavy metal toxicity?
scientificModern Science View	Shilajit might help detoxify the body because of the presence of fulvic and humic acids as they are porous in nature. They absorb harmful chemicals and toxins that build up in the body including heavy metals like lead and mercury and eliminates them[2].
What are the benefits of Shilajit for Hypoxia (low oxygen in tissues)?
scientificModern Science View	Hypoxia is a condition in which the body or some parts of the body do not receive enough oxygen. This might be due to an inadequate amount of blood in the body or inability of blood to carry enough oxygen. Fulvic acid present in Shilajit helps in blood formation and enhances the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Thus, it helps prevent hypoxia[2].
ayurvedicAyurvedic View	Shilajit is known as Yogavahi which means it has the ability to enhance the absorption of elements like iron as well as improves the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.
Tip:
1. Take 1 Shilajit capsule.
2. Swallow it with lukewarm milk after meals, twice a day.

ayurvedicAyurvedic View	Skin problems might occur due to an imbalance of any of the three doshas (Vata, Pita, Kapha), which might lead to inflammation, dryness, itching or irritation of the skin. Giloy helps to manage all these skin problems due to its Tridosha (Vata, Pitta and Kapha) balancing, Snigdha (oily), Kashaya (astringent) and Ropana (healing) properties. This leads to healthy and disease-free skin.

Ashwagandha powder reduces the level of cortisol and helps to reduce stress and stress-related problems[3].
![ayurvedic](https://onemg.gumlet.io/marketing/uexqe6sqz25ttyznrflk.png)
Ayurvedic View
Stress can usually be attributed to an imbalance of Vata dosha, and often presents with irritability, insomnia, and fear. Taking Ashwagandha powder helps in balancing Vata and thus reduces the symptoms of stress.Tip:1. Take 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of Ashwagandha root powder and boil it in 2 cups of water.2. Add a pinch of ginger. Boil till it reduces to half.3. Cool the mixture and add honey to enhance its taste.4. Drink this tea to relax your mind.

Ashwagandha powder reduces the level of cortisol and helps to reduce stress and its associated problems like anxiety[3].
![ayurvedic](https://onemg.gumlet.io/marketing/uexqe6sqz25ttyznrflk.png)

![scientific](https://onemg.gumlet.io/marketing/veb2valla4xaequxvnja.png)
Modern Science View
Ashwagandha is a potent aphrodisiac and might help in stress-induced male infertility by improving the level of testosterone. Ashwagandha has antioxidant property and fights against the free radicals. This prevents damage and death of sperm cells leading to better sperm count and quality. Thus Ashwagandha helps to lower the risk of stress-induced male infertility along with enhancing male sexual health[7].
![ayurvedic](https://onemg.gumlet.io/marketing/uexqe6sqz25ttyznrflk.png)
Ayurvedic View
